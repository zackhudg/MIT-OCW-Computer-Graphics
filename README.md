# MIT-OCW-Computer-Graphics

This code follows along with assignments for my MIT's OpenCourseWare class on Computer Graphics, found at https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-837-computer-graphics-fall-2012/ and with related video lectures at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ3UicqQtfNuKZjdA3fY1_X9gXn13JLlW.

The assignments consisted of starter code provided by the course, which was then edited, added to, or fixed by me for the assignment. Much of the provided starter code was rewritten/updated by me, as it was riginally created for an older version of OpenGL.
